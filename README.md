# Online-Banking-system

Online Banking System that we considered for the project would help the banking
management to manage the customer profile with ease. Online banking is referred
to as internet banking, e-banking, or virtual banking, It is an electronic payment
system that enables clients of banks or other financial institutions to carry out a
variety of financial transactions via the financial institution's website.
In contrast to branch banking, which was the conventional method through which
clients received banking services, the online banking system will generally link to
or be a component of the core banking system managed by a bank. A consumer
with internet connection must register with the financial institution for the service,
set up a password, and provide other credentials for customer verification before
they may access the online banking platform of the institution.
Also, this design helps in careful analysis into comprehensive discussion on the
database design for scaling this to multiple mobile banking apps. The database is
designed in Oracle database. We have included all the essential data integrity
constraints to ensure that data quality is up to standards.
We tried enhancing our database access performance using query optimization. In
this process we have created indexes and data partitioning to enhance the time to
access the data. For certain Functional requirements we have used stored
procedures and they are precompiled to save the execution time. For Further
enhancement, we can migrate the databased to Google Cloud, which will be easier
to access based on the requirements.
